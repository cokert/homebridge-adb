# Homebridge ADB

A simple homebridge script to control remote ADB enabled Android device. The idea is to have a make random Android based TV box can be controlled with Home App. It make your Android device appear as TV accesory, where you can control sleep status, volume and dpad control via remote, and launch certain predefined app defined by you.

This plugins register it self as external accesorries, so make sure after you add your Homebridge bridge to your Home App, manually add accesories to add the device you want to control via Home App

## Prerequisite

* Install Homebridge (and Homebridge UI X if you want, this plugin support web configuration over there) and this plugins
	```
	sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge homebridge-adb
	```

* Make sure you install ADB at the same machine as your Homebridge.
	*  If you're using Ubuntu, use this command:
		```
		sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
		```
	*  If you're using Alpine Linux (like the one from of oznu/docker-homebridge), use this command:
		```
		apk --update-cache --repository http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/ add android-tools
		```
	*  For other OS and method please download it in here: [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)
	*  When it properly installed, please check your ADB is up and running with this command: 
		```
		adb version
		```

* Enable Developer mode in your Android device, visit this documentation to read more  [https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)

* Some Android device doesn't have remote debug by default. If your device is one of them, connect your device with USB cable to your server (or any computer with ADB installed) and run this command:
	```
	adb tcpip 5555
	```
	after that, just disconnect the USB cable from your server.

* _Optionally_, run this command to make sure you can connect to device:
	```
	adb connect your-device-ip
	```
	If all goes well, there will be a popup window in your android device asking for debug permission. After you accept the request, you might want to do kill the adb server to make a fresh connection
	```
	adb kill-server
	```
	After that reconnect your device again with previous adb connect. And after that, you should able to run this command
	```
	adb -s your-device-ip shell "getprop ro.product.model"
	```
	and get it will output your device model.

## Docker container based upon [oznu/docker-homebridge](https://github.com/oznu/docker-homebridge)

* Append the followings line to your `config/startup.sh` to install this plugin on every container restart:
	```shell
	# Install the homebridge-adb plugin
	npm install homebridge-adb
	```

* If you're using a container based on Alpine Linux (like `oznu/docker-homebridge:latest`), append this line to your `config/startup.sh` to install adb automatically
	```shell
	# Install adb, required by the homebridge-adb plugin
	apk --update-cache --repository http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/testing/ add android-tools
	```

* If you're using a container based on Debian (like the `oznu/docker-homebridge:ubuntu` & `oznu/docker-homebridge:debian` docker image), append the following lines to your `config/startup.sh` to install adb automatically
	```shell
	# Update apt package index
	apt-get update

	# Install adb, required by the homebridge-adb plugin
	apt-get install -y android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot
	```

* _Optionally_, if you run into issues when connecting to your android device (sometimes adb can't create the `$HOME/.android/adbkey`), add this line to your `config/startup.sh`:
	```shell
	# Fix connection issues for the homebridge-adb plugin
	adb connect $YOUR_ANDROID_DEVICE_IP
	```

## Configuration

Here an example of configuration that you can use. If you're using Homebridge Config UI X, you can configure your device there, but there's a small hiccup with Inputs. It only display one input, but if you press add, it will display the rest of the inputs.

## FAQ

* Where can I use volume and D-Pad control for my device?
	* First turn on "Apple TV Remote" control from your iOS device inside Settings -> Control Center. Then swipe down Control Center, you'll see a remote icon. Tap the remote icon to open the remote, you can use your iOS device screen for the D-Pad, and use your iOS device physical volume button to control your device volume.
* Why I can't turn on my device after turning it off?
	* Your device might disconnected from network connection after you turn off your device. You need to turn it on manually. Or, please make sure your device still able to recieve network connection when it turned off, check your device settings for it.
* Is this safe?
	* Actually I don't know, it feels very dirty (I need to wash my hand everytime I use this) and hacky, but it works for me.
* I found some bugs, what should I do?
	* You can submit your bugs here [https://github.com/dwaan/homebridge-adb/issues](https://github.com/dwaan/homebridge-adb/issues) or you can help me to fix it by sending pull request.
* Can this plugins do (insert stuff you want to do to your device)?
	* I think so, ADB can basically control your device remotely. If you have other idea for what this can do, you can submit your idea as an issue.
* Can I buy you a beer?
	* No, [but you can buy me an Ice cream](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dwaan). But if you like this plugins feel free to stared this repo.
